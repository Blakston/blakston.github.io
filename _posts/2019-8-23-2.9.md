## General Changes

---

- **Elusion** now displays the caster’s guild hall as a location, if they have one and can teleport there. Also, making a typo in the destination won’t make the spell fail.
- Added more spawn points to **Thrasher’s Lair** as monster density was a bit low.
- **Acid, fire, and ice arrows** now give off a small amount of light (green, red, and blue, respectively).
- **Morph** and **Illusionary Form** now display buff duration when right-clicking the buff icon.
- **Morph time** is now capped at 15 minutes, as morphing into a low-level mob as a high HP caster could give cast times up to 45 minutes.
- Clarified the quest text for the **Jala necklace quest**, specifying that the NPC requires a regular lute, not a fine or true lute.
- **Guildmasters** can now pick a new Guild shield for their Guild without needing to disband and recreate it. This can be done every 6 hours by default.
- **Dynamic lighting** on objects with multiple lights now works additively rather than one strong effect overriding others.
- A new **death message** is displayed when an angeled character is killed to differentiate their deaths from those where characters drop loot.
- A **system message** is displayed when a player loses honor points through logging/phasing in PvP.
- **Character creation** now offers 125 points to distribute between level 1 and 2 spells/skills. Players must select two level 1 abilities in a school before selecting a level 2 ability in that school.

## Ogre Client Changes

---

- **Left double-click** can now activate objects like chests, mana nodes, levers, etc.
- **Object/ability description UI** dynamically resizes if the text is too small to fit in the original container.
- **Inventory size** more closely matches the number of items the player holds (less empty rows), and the 200-item display maximum has been removed.
- Fixed a **graphics issue** where some objects might not show up if ‘Native’ or ‘DirectDraw’ were selected or had an incorrect offset with ‘GDI’.
- Fixed a **rare shader-related client crash**.
- Fixed **character stat allocation sliders** disappearing in character creation.
- Fixed a **bug preventing name change scrolls** from being used in Ogre.
- Fixed a **stat change issue** where incorrect stats were sent to the server under rare circumstances.

## Classic Client Changes

---

- **Refactored the BGF texture cache**, using slightly more memory but increasing performance.
- Moved **dynamic lighting toggle** from the Configuration menu to the Graphics menu.
- Adjusted **floor/ceiling/door animations** to match expected server values, fixing issues in the **Lupogg King’s treasure area**.
- Added a **‘wireframe’ toggle option** in the Graphics menu to improve performance.
- Fixed **odd UI window sizing** in the German version of the Guild UI.
- Adjusted **UI redrawing** to reduce flashing when changing rooms.
- Improved **rendering calculations and light rendering** for better performance.
- **Reduced CPU usage** while the client is minimized.

## New Skill – Cleave

---

![Ogre Cleave](https://meridiannext.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ogre_cleave.png)

- A new skill, **Cleave**, is available in level 5 **Weaponcraft**.
- **Cleave** allows a player to attack multiple targets in their line of sight and range.
- Execution time: **1.5 seconds** (compared to 1 second for regular attacks).
- Damage formula: `Regular weapon damage * [(skill percent + 1)/2 + might]`
- **Cleave** is an **active skill**, performed manually via the ‘perform’ command.
- The skill can be purchased from **Johlan Tulca** in **The Arena of Death in Tos**.

## Spellcasting and Trance (Spell Focus) Changes

---

- **Trance** no longer breaks while running but reduces movement speed by **50%**.
- **Taking damage while casting** won’t break trance until a cumulative **10% of max health** is dealt.
- **Taking damage while casting** extends cast time while concentration is maintained.
- **Trance break** doubles the spell’s post-cast delay.
- **Trance can be canceled** by hitting the **space bar** during casting.
- **Canceling trance refunds** half of the spell’s **mana and vigor cost**.
- **Attempting to cast the same spell** again while casting won’t interrupt the spell.
- **Mana focus enchantment** now reduces movement speed by **30%** rather than breaking while running.

## Wall Spell Changes

---

![Ogre Wall Spell](https://meridiannext.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ogre_wallspell-1.png)

- **Wall spells now depend on spellpower** for the number and layout of spawned elements.
- **Wall placement angle accuracy** has been improved.
- **Wall elements use a finer grid**, making their relative position independent of casting angle.
- **Summoning limits are now caster-based** rather than room-based.
- **Caster’s soft summoning limit** is calculated as: `(2 * mysticism + 1 * stamina) / 3`.
- **Walls that do damage now apply effects over time** rather than dealing instant damage:
  - **Firewall/Illusionary Firewall**: Causes a **burn effect** (8 damage/sec for 2.5 sec).
  - **Lightning Wall**: Causes an **electrify effect** (12 damage/sec for 0.5 sec).
  - **Poison Fog**: Applies **stacking poison** (0.8 damage/sec and 0.2 vigor/sec for 30 sec).
  - **Brambles**: Causes **bleed effect** (2 damage/sec for 10 sec) plus minor piercing damage.
- **New summoning mechanics:**
  - **Firewall/Lightning Wall/Brambles**: Up to **27 elements in 3 rows** based on spellpower.
  - **Fog/Poison Fog**: Up to **27 elements in a spiral pattern** based on spellpower.
  - **Spore Burst**: Up to **27 elements around the caster** based on spellpower.
  - **Ring of Flames**: Swirls fire around the target, expanding over **12 seconds**.
